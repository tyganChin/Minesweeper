1. Download the files
2. Ensure you have the Make utility installed in order to run the program
3. Download the SFML library and link to program by including the path to the 
   SFML include and lib folders in the MakeFile IFLAGS and LDFLAGS
4. Type make to build the program
5. Type ./minesweeper in the terminal to run the game
6. Adjust the size of the menus and the board if needed in Game_Constants.h file
    - The rest of the menus and board should scale with these two constants
    - Made to fit a 13.6 inch Macbook
7. Choose a difficulty (easy, medium, or hard)
8. Click on any of the cells (guaranteed to not be a mine)
9. Use the numbers in the cells which represent the number of mines adjacent to 
   it to find out where the bombs are
10. Press the space bar to place a flag on the cell your cursor is hovering 
    over to help keep track of which cells have bombs and which do not
11. Reveal all of the cells without mines in order to window
12. Press anywhere on the window to skip the ending animation
